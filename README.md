# Rock Paper Scissors (Terminal Game)

A simple terminal-based implementation of the classic **Rock Paper Scissors** game.

The player competes against the computer, which randomly selects its move each round.

## How the Game Works

Each round:

- You enter: `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors`
- The computer randomly selects its choice
- The winner is determined by standard rules:

| Player Choice | Beats    |
| ------------- | -------- |
| Rock          | Scissors |
| Paper         | Rock     |
| Scissors      | Paper    |

If both choices are the same, the round ends in a tie.

## How to Play

1. Run the program in your terminal.
2. Type one of the following:
   - `rock`
   - `paper`
   - `scissors`

## Example Gameplay

```
